# Momentum-Trading-Optimization
Final Project for Optimization Modeling for Finance

In this project we combined simple momentum trading strategy and Markovitz portfolio optimization. On each rebalance day after we determine the list of stock to long/short, and we put this list of stock in the markovitz ooptimzation algorithm. In order to make our strategy more robust, we tested the parameters for simple momentum trading as well as the appropriate expected return and covariance matrix to be used in portfolio optimization.
